# Kotlin Multiplatform RocksDB implementation

This project provides a multiplatform Kotlin implementation for RocksDB, a high-performance embedded key-value store for 
storage of data on disk. RocksDB is widely used in many industries for various applications, including database management 
systems, big data systems, and storage engines for other distributed systems.

The aim of this project is to provide a multiplatform RocksDB implementation that can be used across different platforms,
including JVM, Android, and native Linux/macOS/iOS/tvOS/watchOS/Windows. This allows developers to write applications that can run on different platforms 
without having to rewrite the codebase.

This project is useful for developers who want to build multiplatform applications that require high-performance disk-based
storage. By using this implementation of RocksDB in their codebase, developers can ensure that their application is portable 
across different platforms while maintaining a high level of performance and reliability.

## RocksDB API Support

The project supports the full RocksDB Java interfaces on the JVM and Android platforms. 
This common library includes most common operations, but if you need additional features, you can request 
them by creating an issue or submitting a merge request.

## Supported platforms 

- **JVM** - linux32, linux32-musl, linux64, linux64-musl, macOS, win64 (Same as RocksDBJava) 
- **Android** - arm64-v8a, armeabi-v7a, x86, x86_64 (Default Android native build targets)

Kotlin Native:
- **macOS**: macosArm64 & macosX64
- **iOS**: iosArm64 & iosSimulatorArm64
- **watchOS**: watchosArm64, watchosDeviceArm64 & watchosSimulatorArm64
- **tvOS**: tvosArm64 & tvosSimulatorArm64
- **Linux**: linuxX64 & linuxArm64
- **Windows**: mingwX64
- **Android**: androidNativeArm32, androidNativeArm64, androidNativeX86 & androidNativeX64

## Reference

You can refer to the [API reference](src/commonMain/kotlin/maryk/rocksdb) or the official [RocksDB website](https://rocksdb.org) for more information.

## Gradle Dependency

The dependency is published in Maven Central, so you can easily add it to your project:

```kotlin
implementation("io.maryk.rocksdb:rocksdb-multiplatform:10.4.6")
```

## Usage Example

Here's an example of how to open a RocksDB database, write a key-value pair and retrieve the value by key:
```kotlin
openRocksDB("path_to_store_on_disk").use { db ->
    val key = "test".encodeToByteArray()
    db.put(key, "value".encodeToByteArray())
    
    val value = db.get("test".encodeToByteArray())
    
    println(value?.decodeToString())
}
```

package maryk.rocksdb

/**
 * Represents a RocksDB instance with transaction support.
 *
 * `TransactionDB` extends the functionality of `RocksDB` by providing
 * transactional capabilities, allowing for atomic operations across multiple
 * key-value pairs. It implements the [TransactionalDB] interface, parameterized
 * with [TransactionOptions], to facilitate transaction management.
 *
 * **Example Usage:**
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val options = Options().setCreateIfMissing(true)
 * val transactionDbOptions = TransactionDBOptions()
 * val transactionDB = TransactionDB.open(options, transactionDbOptions, "/path/to/db")
 *
 * val writeOptions = WriteOptions().setSync(true)
 * val txn = transactionDB.beginTransaction(writeOptions)
 *
 * try {
 *     txn.put("key1", "value1")
 *     txn.put("key2", "value2")
 *     txn.commit()
 * } catch (e: RocksDBException) {
 *     txn.rollback()
 * } finally {
 *     txn.close()
 *     transactionDB.close()
 * }
 * ```
